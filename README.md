# Boston-Housing-Neural-Regression
Neural Network implementing simple linear regression with K-validation. I used the Boston-Housing dataset from MLDatasets. Linear regression with 3 layers is implemented. MAE is used for accuracy and MSE for the loss function. The MAE stops improving after around 200 epochs (overfitting). It might be useful to also implement regularization or dropout techniques. 

This code is simply a demo for linear regression using neural networks using Flux.jl. It is not optimized and serves solely as an example on how to run regressions with Deep Learning.

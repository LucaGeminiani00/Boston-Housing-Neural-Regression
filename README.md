# Boston-Housing-Neural-Regression
Neural Network implementing simple linear regression with K-validation. The dataset used in the Boston-Housing dataset from MLDatasets. Linear regression with 64 hidden layers is implemented. MAE is used for accuracy and MSE for the loss function. The last lines of code provide a visual representation of the decreasing behavior of the MAE. The MAE stops improving after around 200 epochs. 

This code is simply a demo for linear regression using neural networks using Flux.jl. It is not optimized and serves solely as an example on how to run regressions with Deep Learning.
